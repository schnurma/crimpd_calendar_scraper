Script to import the calendar from the Climbing Training App Crimpd to a .csv file
for further use.</br>

With the use of different calendars from different apps and programs like Google,
Garmin, etc. I want to create a handy tool for syncing my training data from 
climbing with my google calendar.

As part of my CS50P final project the first step is to create the web scraper cli 
tool to transform the scraped dataset to a readable .csv file to open it with excel.

* Author(s): Martin Schnur
